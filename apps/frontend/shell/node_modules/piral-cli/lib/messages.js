 * When the Piral CLI detects that you want to share such a dependency from an app shell,
 * or alternatively within a pilet directly, it will print a warning. There might be false
 * positives here, so having an error here might be a bit too much. Nevertheless, depending
 * on your scenario you might want to treat these warnings as errors.
 *
 * @see
 * - [Sharing dependencies](https://docs.piral.io/concepts/I08-importmap)
 *
 * @example
 * Check the contents of the available package.json:
 *
 * ```sh
 * cat package.json
 * ```
 *
 * The displayed content should look similar to (i.e., contain an importmap such as):
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "importmap": {
 *     "imports": {
 *       "piral-ng": ""
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This would share the whole Piral plugin, which does not make much sense. First of all,
 * the plugin is presumably already installed - it even could only be installed in a
 * Piral instance. Second, there is no use of the exported function somewhere else.
 *
 * Instead, you potentially might want to share a submodule. For instance, in the example
 * above the "piral-ng/common" submodule should be shared.
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "importmap": {
 *     "imports": {
 *       "piral-ng/common": ""
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

 *

 * - v1: will use a script tag for integration of the pilet
 * - v2: will use SystemJS for integration of the pilet (default)
 * - mf: will use Module Federation for integration of the pilet (only supported bundlers)
 *
 * The v1 version has better support for older browsers, but requires a polyfill to work
 * correctly. This polyfill is part of the `piral-ie11polyfills-utils` package.
 * Alternatively, use the `currentScript-polyfill` package.
 *

 * but requires the custom format as output. Most bundlers support SystemJS directly or
 * indirectly, making it a quite broad choice.
